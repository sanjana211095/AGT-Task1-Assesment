## Steps to build and deploy this model
- First we have create a small dataset of UI
- Then, we train model using YOLOv8 algorithm for multiple object detection in a one shot, we use google colab for training the model as it need GPU to process
- After training process complete we get the pre-trained model and their metrices of trained model
- Then, we develope a small web application using streamlit to deploy a model and provide as user-interface
- We use computer vision library to read the image and execute the output
